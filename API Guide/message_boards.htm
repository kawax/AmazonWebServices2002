<div class="header">Using the Developer’s Message Board and Reporting Bugs</div>
<p class="bodycopy">This section shows the process for using the developer’s message 
  board to post messages and report bugs and the appropriate format.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">Amazon Web Services Message Boards</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">This section describes the Amazon Web Services Developer and 
  Announcement message boards.</p>
<h3 class="subhead2">Developer Message Board</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">We have provided a forum to discuss Amazon.com Web Services 
  with other developers at http://forums.prospero.com/am-assocdevxml. And if you 
  have feedback you'd like to send us, please feel free to do so.  You can contact 
  us at webservices@amazon.com. </p>
<p class="bodycopy"><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Please note</font></strong>: 
  Amazon holds regular developer chats on topics related to implementing Web services. 
  Please check the announcements board for our schedule of chats.</em></p>
<h3 class="subhead2">Announcement Board</h3>
<p class="bodycopy">The Amazon Web Services team will post announcements about 
  new features and new services releases to the announcement board.  Please check 
  this announcement board regularly to make sure you have the most up-to-date 
  information available.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">Sample Bug Report</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">If you encounter a bug and would like to report it to Amazon 
  for resolution, enter the bug on the developer’s message board instead of sending 
  the bug directly to Amazon Web Services.  When you post to the developer’s board, 
  you’re creating a public record of the problem and the solution.  The entire 
  development community can help to solve the problem, and the entire community 
  can benefit.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">To file a bug on the developer’s board, include the following 
  information in a bug report:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class="bodycopy">Type of request that you tried: </li>
  <ol start=1 type=a>
    <li class="bodycopy">XML/HTTP - include the entire URL</li>
    <li class="bodycopy">SOAP - include the name, version, and URL of any tools 
      or toolkit that you used</li>
    <li class="bodycopy">XSLT - include the entire URL, including the URL of the 
      XSLT file</li>
  </ol>
  <li class="bodycopy">Parameters that you supplied to the request</li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Expected results</li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Observed results and/or error messages</li>
</ol>
<p class="bodycopy">Amazon.com takes all Web Services problem reports seriously, 
  and takes reasonable measures to reproduce them in an effort to determine their 
  potential impact.  If a problem can be reproduced, we generally post a note 
  to the Announcement Board when it is fixed.</p>
<p class="bodycopy">Please be aware that it is not possible for Amazon.com to 
  provide technical support to specific individuals.  However, you will from time 
  to time see us respond to questions that we believe are of general interest 
  to the broad community of developers.</p>
