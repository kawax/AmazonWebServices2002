<p class="bodycopy"><a>Using Web services, you can now enable your Web site visitors 
  to add products to Amazon.com shopping carts, wedding registries, baby registries 
  and wish lists directly from your site. HTML or JavaScript code is provided 
  in all of the following examples. If you are an Associate and want to receive 
  credit for purchases through your buttons, you should insert your Associates 
  ID in the appropriate places in the code. Otherwise, you can simply use the 
  generic “webservices-20” ID.</a></p>
<p class="bodycopy"><a><b><i><span style='color:red'>Please note</span></i></b><i>:&nbsp;With 
  the exception of Section 12.2, &quot;Adding Items to Shopping Carts&quot;, the 
  following functionality is not available for our UK Web Services.  Though you 
  can add items to cart with UK Web Services, we recommend you do not do so because 
  your Associate ID will not be tagged on the order items placed.</i></a></p>
