<p class=subhead>Document Audience</p>
  
<p class="bodycopy">Thanks for downloading the Amazon.com Web Services software 
  developers kit. Two audiences who will find this document useful are:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Web site owners</b> who want to enhance their Web site 
    with Amazon content and features.  Many developers have already developed 
    components to make it easy to work with Amazon Web Services.  To see some 
    of the components, please see <span style='color:blue'><a
     href="http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/567634">http://associates.amazon.com/exec/panama/associates/ntg/browse/-/567634</a></span>.</li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Developers</b> who wish to experiment with or create 
    applications built on Amazon.com Web Services. </li>
</ol>
  
<h2><a class="subhead">Overview</a></h2>
  
<p class="bodycopy">The first Web services that we have exposed are: </p>
<ul type=disc>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Product Display</b> - The ability to search for and 
    retrieve product information from the Amazon.com catalog, including filtering 
    for products sold by specific third-party sellers. </li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Shopping Cart</b> - The ability to add Amazon.com products 
    to shopping carts, wish lists, and registries from third-party locations. 
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="bodycopy">Using these services, Web site owners and developers can now 
  create applications capable of interacting with Amazon.com's catalog, search 
  engine, shopping cart and merchandising tools to provide more robust offerings 
  on third-party Web sites. Instead of simply linking to our various products, 
  they can embed search results, top sellers, customized lists, recommendations, 
  and even the Amazon.com shopping cart within their applications. And with our 
  XSLT engine, they can convert standard Web services XML into customizable snippets 
  of HTML, making it even easier to use our data. </p>
<p class="bodycopy">This document should contain all you need to get started. 
  We have provided a forum to discuss Amazon.com Web Services with other developers 
  at <a href="http://forums.prospero.com/am-assocdevxml">http://forums.prospero.com/am-assocdevxml</a>. 
  And if you have feedback you'd like to send us, please feel free to do so - 
  you can contact us at <a href="mailto:webservices@amazon.com">webservices@amazon.com</a>.
