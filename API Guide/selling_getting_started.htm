  <h2><a class="subhead">What Are Amazon Web Services for Sellers?</a></h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">Amazon Web Services for Sellers provides a secure and automated 
    method to upload inventory details to Amazon.com (zShops and Amazon Marketplace) 
    on a scheduled basis. It also enables the automation of other important seller 
    activities such as generating order reports and issuing bulk refunds. This 
    is a first step toward real-time updates that will enable selling partners 
    to better manage their inventory in multiple physical and virtual locations. 
  </p>
  <p class="bodycopy">This project utilizes HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol 
    Secure), a protocol that is designed to transfer encrypted information between 
    computers over the World Wide Web. HTTPS is a unique protocol that combines 
    SSL and HTTP to provide secure data transmission. The goal of this document 
    is to help our valued partners understand the technical requirements of our 
    HTTPS solution.</p>
  <h2 class="subhead">Getting Registered</h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">In order to sell products on the Amazon Web site, you’ll 
    first need to register with Amazon.com.  To get started, see the <a
href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/1161232/ref=br_lr_/104-8908261-1003914">help 
    information</a> contained on the Amazon Web site.</p>
  <h2><a class="subhead">Security</a></h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">Use of HTTPS ensures that all data uploads and downloads 
    will be encrypted and secure. </p>
  <p class="bodycopy">Sellers will need to use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and 
    PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) technology to communicate securely with Amazon.com—if 
    you are using Perl, note that both of these technologies are built into Perl 
    to ensure that scripts written to automate the data communication are correctly 
    configured.</p>
  <p class="bodycopy">The identity of the seller will be verified using the &quot;Basic 
    HTTP Authentication Scheme.&quot; The seller will provide his or her e-mail 
    address and password in the HTTPS header, encoded using base64.&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><a class="subhead">Automation</a> </h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">Please note that the below instructions are detailed for 
    partners using Perl. However, you may use any language.</p>
  <h3><a class="subhead2">Script Configuration</a> </h3>
  <p class="bodycopy">In order to automate the secure uploading and retrieval 
    of files and/or reports, selling partners will need to create an HTTPS client. 
    This client will consist of scripts that automate the uploading and retrieval 
    of files. </p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li class="bodycopy"><b>Upload:</b> To upload a file, the seller uses a Perl 
      script that they have written to send a POST request with the file attached 
      in the request body. The seller should include both their Amazon.com e-mail 
      address and password in the request header.</li>
    <li class="bodycopy"><b>Retrieve:</b> To retrieve a file, the seller sends 
      a POST request for the particular file. Amazon.com sends the requested file 
      in an HTTPS response, at which point the seller would redirect the response 
      to a specified directory and then save the file.</li>
    <li class="bodycopy"><b>Notifications:</b> Selling partners who participate 
      in the HTTPS solution can have the automatic e-mail notifications from Amazon.com 
      regarding uploads and reports turned off, relying instead on the HTTPS responses 
      in XML.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="bodycopy">If an upload fails due to internal error, Amazon.com will 
    send e-mail with the batch status and information<b>.</b></p>
  <p class="bodycopy"><b>&nbsp;NOTE: </b>Your script will need to include the 
    cookie value – here is a sample of this code in Perl: </p>
  <p class=Code>$request-&gt;headers-&gt;push_header('Cookie',&quot;x-main=YvjPkwfntqDKun0QEmVRPcTTZDMe?Tn?;ubid-main=002-8989859-9917520;ubid-tacbus=019-5423258-4241018;x-tacbus=vtm4d53DvX\@Sc9LxTnAnxsFL3DorwxJa;
