<p class=header>Working with Product Variation Relationships</p>
<p class="bodycopy">A <i>product variation relationship</i> is the relationship 
  between a product and all available variations of that product.  For example, 
  you might sell a specific type of bell-bottomed pants.  “Bell-bottomed Pants” 
  would be the parent item (the generic identifier), and the blue, green, and 
  red versions of those pants would be the child items.  Product variation relationships 
  enable you to present all available versions of a product to your customers 
  by linking the parent items with their respective children.  Examples of common 
  variation themes include size, color, color &amp; size or material.  Because 
  they identify the generic version of a product, parent ASINs are not sellable 
  items—only the variations (the blue, green, and red versions of the pants) are 
  sellable items.</p>
