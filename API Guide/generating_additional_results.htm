<h2 class="header">Generating Additional Product Results</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">Because some queries could potentially return a large number 
  of results, Amazon breaks down the results and returns them in ten-item chunks. 
   To obtain more than ten results for a search, you simply need to pass a &quot;page&quot; 
  parameter in your URL. For example, to get the top 30 books written by Stephen 
  King (instead of simply the top 10), you would need to make three separate calls 
  into Amazon.com, with the parameters page=1 (which will give you books #1 through 
  #10), page=2 (books #11 through #20) and page=3 (books #21 through #30). </p>
<p class="bodycopy">Specifying a page value of&nbsp;<b>1</b> requests the first 
  page, <b>2</b> the second, and so forth.&nbsp;A special value&nbsp;called <b>TotalResults</b> 
  is returned as a part of any request that can return more than one result. This 
  value indicates the total number of items (not pages) that are available from 
  the query.  The total number of pages that are available from the query will 
  be returned in a value called <b>TotalPages</b>.<span style='color:blue'> </span></p>
<p class="bodycopy">The process for obtaining “<b>N</b>” items in a search is 
  to create an algorithm as shown:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class="bodycopy">Form the basic query&nbsp;(omitting the page parameter)</li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Set a page variable to <b>1</b></li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Finalize the query by inserting&nbsp;the page variable 
    into the basic query</li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Issue the query</li>
  <li class="bodycopy">Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the desired number of results 
    have been fetched</li>
</ol>
