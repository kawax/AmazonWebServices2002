  <h2><a class="subhead">Schedule</a></h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">File processing will be restricted to one file at a time. 
    For example, if a seller has a scheduled upload at the same time he or she 
    schedules a delete file pickup, the requests will be queued in the order received 
    so that only one request will be processed at a time. </p>
  <p class="bodycopy">If a purge and replace request fails, the remaining files 
    in the queue will continue to be processed. To avoid data corruption, it will 
    be the sellers’ responsibility to submit a fresh purge and replace request 
    in the next schedule. If it is urgent that a purge and replace file is processed 
    before the next scheduled pickup, the seller can instead use the manual upload 
    found using the following URL:</p>

  </p>
  <ul type=disc>
    <li class="bodycopy">The POST requests for inventory upload (Add/Modify/Delete) 
      should be sent every four hours or multiples of four hours (12 midnight, 
      4a.m., 8a.m., 12 noon, 4p.m., 8p.m. daily) All times PST</li>
    <li class="bodycopy">The POST requests associated with the purge and replace 
      should be either sent every 12 midnight or every Friday 12 midnight . If 
      the purge and replace file is going to be over 20 MB, it should only be 
      scheduled for pickup once a week. </li>
    <li class="bodycopy">The POST requests associated with the upload of delete 
      can be sent as frequent as every 30 minutes or multiples of 30 minutes.</li>

  <h1><a class="subhead">Status Notifications</a> </h1>
  <h2><a class="subhead2">Email</a> </h2>
  <p class="bodycopy">We will not send e-mail notifying successful pick up because 
    the seller will receive an automatic response as part of the HTTPS protocol. 
  </p>
  <p class="bodycopy">E-mail will be sent if an upload batch fails do to an internal 
    error. This e-mail will include information regarding the number of records, 
    if any, that were processed before the batch failure and will instruct the 
    seller to resubmit the file.</p>
  <h2><a class="subhead2">Failure/Edge Case Notification</a></h2>
  <h3><a class="subhead2">Login Failure</a></h3>
  <p class="bodycopy">When login and password fails for any request, the HTTPS 
    response will include a 404 error that notifies the seller that there was 
    an error on the client’s end. </p>
  <h3><a class="subhead2">Business Logic Validation Failures</a></h3>
  <p class="bodycopy">There are two levels of business logic failures </p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li class="bodycopy">When a request is submitted.  If a request fails at submission 
      time, the error will be returned in the HTTPS response.</li>
    <li class="bodycopy">When the request is processed </li>
  </ol>
  <p class="bodycopy">If the request fails during processing (no records are valid) 
    the error(s) will be noted in the error log file, which can be downloaded 
    as explained in the previous sections. </p>
  <h3><a class="subhead2">File Fatal Processing</a> </h3>
  <p class="bodycopy">Because the file processing is done asynchronously, if a 
    processing fatals, Amazon.com will send e-mail stating that the request caused 
    a fatal error and that the file should be resubmitted.</p>
