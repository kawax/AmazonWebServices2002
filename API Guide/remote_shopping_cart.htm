<div class="header">Using the Remote Shopping Cart</div>
<p class="bodycopy">This section explains how to use the remote shopping cart 
  to add items to a cart and manage that shopping cart from a remote Web site 
  or application.  This enables you to keep the customer on your site or application 
  for the duration of their shopping session.</p>
<h2 class="subhead">Elements of Remote Shopping Cart Calls</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">The following elements are returned by the Add call. The Cart 
  ID and HMAC values returned by that call serve to identify the shopping cart 
  and must be passed unchanged to the other shopping carts requests described 
  in this section.</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Cart ID</b>.  The Cart ID is the unique identifier for 
    a given customer.</li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>HMAC</b>.  The HMAC is a security token that must be 
    passed back to Amazon Web Services for using an existing cart. This token 
    is uniquely associated with each cart. When using the REST API, HMAC must 
    be URL-encoded, so the <b>+</b> sign in the URL must be converted to <b>%2B</b> 
    (otherwise the browser will interpret this as a space).</li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Purchase URL</b>.  The purchase URL must be included 
    in your link to enable purchasing from a cart.  The purchase URL transfers 
    items from your local cart to the Amazon.com shopping cart.  Your site or 
    application must provide a user interface which allows the user to &quot;click&quot; 
    on this URL and to display the result.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="subhead">Remote Shopping Cart Process</h2>
<p class="bodycopy">This section shows the process for creating a cart, modifying 
  the cart, and uploading the cart to Amazon for processing.</p>

<p class="bodycopy">Creating and managing a remote shopping cart involves one 
  or more of the following steps:</p>
<ol start=1 type=1>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Creating the Cart</b>.  In order to create the cart, 
    you simply need to send an add item request to AWS that contains an item for 
    inclusion in the cart.  </li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Adding Items</b>.  As your customer shops, they may 
    decide to add items to their cart.  You can enable this with the Add Items 
    request.</li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Modifying the Cart</b>.  Your customer may decide to 
    delete an item or change the number of a given item.  You enable this with 
    the Modify Cart request.  You can also retrieve items from the cart or clear 
    the cart entirely.</li>
  <li class="bodycopy"><b>Transfer the cart to Amazon</b>.  When the customer 
    is ready to make the purchase, you upload the cart to Amazon for order processing 
    using the Purchase URL.  <b><i><span style='color:red'>Please note</span></i></b><i>:  
    Once the customer clicks on the purchasing URL, remote interaction with the 
    cart is no longer possible.&nbsp; Any modifications to the cart at this point 
    must be made on Amazon.com</i></li>
</ol>
