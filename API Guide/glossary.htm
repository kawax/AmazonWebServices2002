        Object Access Protocol provides a way for applications to communicate 
        with each other over the Internet, independent of platform. Unlike OMG's 
        IIOP, SOAP piggybacks a DOM onto HTTP (port 80) in order to penetrate 
        server firewalls, which are usually configured to accept port 80 and port 
        21 (FTP) requests. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>SOAP relies on XML to define the format of the information 
        and then adds the necessary HTTP headers to send it. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>SOAP was developed by Microsoft, DevelopMentor, and Userland 
        Software and has been proposed to the Internet Engineering Task Force 
        (IETF) as a standard. </p></td>

        a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer puts the 
        blocks together. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>Most operating environments provide an API so that programmers 
        can write applications consistent with the operating environment. Although 
        APIs are designed for programmers, they are ultimately good for users 
        because they guarantee that all programs using a common API will have 
        similar interfaces. This makes it easier for users to learn new programs.

        used to describe content in an SGML document, where each tag is allowed, 
        and which tags can appear within other tags. For example, in a DTD one 
        could say that LIST tags can contain ITEM tags, but ITEM tags cannot contain 
        LIST tags. In some editors, when authors are inputting information, they 
        can place tags only where the DTD allows. This ensures that all the documentation

        Hypertext Preprocessor is a server-side, HTML embedded scripting language 
        used to create dynamic Web pages. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>In an HTML document, PHP script (similar syntax to that 
        of Perl or C) is enclosed within special PHP tags. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>Because PHP is embedded within tags, the author can jump 
        between HTML and PHP (similar to ASP and Cold Fusion) instead of having 
        to rely on heavy amounts of code to output HTML. And, because PHP is executed 
        on the server, the client cannot view the PHP code. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>PHP can perform any task any CGI program can do, but its 
        strength lies in its compatibility with many types of databases. Also, 
        PHP can talk across networks using IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, or HTTP. </p>
      <p class=bodycopy>PHP was created sometime in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. During 
        mid 1997, PHP development entered the hands of other contributors. Two 
        of them, Zeev Suraski and Andi Gutmans, rewrote the parser from scratch 
        to create PHP version 3 (PHP3). </p></td>

        specification for a dynamically created Web page with an .ASP extension 
        that utilizes ActiveX scripting -- usually VB Script or Jscript code. 
        When a browser requests an ASP page, the Web server generates a page with 
        HTML code and sends it back to the browser. So ASP pages are similar to 
        CGI scripts, but they enable Visual Basic programmers to work with familiar 
        tools.</p></td>

        for Extensible Style Language, a specification for separating style from 
        content when creating HTML or XML pages. The specifications work much 
        like templates, allowing designers to apply single style documents to 
        multiple pages. XSL is the second style specification to be offered by 
        the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).  The first, called Cascading Style 
        Sheets (CSS), is similar to XSL but does not include two major XSL innovations 
        -- allowing developers to dictate the way Web pages are printed, and specifications 
        allowing one to transfer XML documents across different applications. 
        W3C released the first draft of XSL in August 1998, and promotes the specifications 
        as helpful to the Web's speed, accessibility, and maintenance.</p></td>
