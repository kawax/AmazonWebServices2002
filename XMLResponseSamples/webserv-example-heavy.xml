            <Summary>height of stupidity</Summary>
            <Comment>This is really an idiot's delight when it comes to dog training. The author proposes such amusing training techniques as climbing in and out of your window and chewing your dog's food before feeding it to the dog and it's all based on the author's absurd notion of instinctual canine behavoir - as if she has a clue. There are much, much better and far more rational books for dog owners beset by difficult dogs than this including another book with the same title. &lt;P>When you get right down to it, the best way to cope with sharing your life with a dog is to be very careful in selecting the breed, gender and temperment that's appropriate for your life style. All of these factors can and should be considered before adopting a dog but mimicking alpha wolf behavoir as the author feels she alone understands it, will only leave the dog owner feeling like an idiot while your dog is either bemused or freaked out.</Comment>

            <Summary>Kind dog training but also some questionable advice</Summary>
            <Comment>This is an updated review. I've read the book a couple of more times and I'm now a bit more positive to the book than before, so I give it one more star now (starting with only two) stars. There aren't many dog training books that try to teach you how to become alpha in such a calm way, you got to give the author credit for that. &lt;P>The general idea is good: leadership without hurting or scaring the dog. Jan's methods are positive. Much of them work because of the laws of operant conditioning: Reward what you want, ignore what you don't want. The problem is that Jan has a few rather crazy explanations why her methods work - or, rather, work eventually, as it sometimes seems to take weeks and months to fix some problems. She thinks that most problem behaviors are caused by the dog thinking it is the leader of the household. &lt;P>This might be true, but I question some things that she writes. For example, she says that a dog suffering from separation anxiety thinks it is the owner's "parent" and when the owner leaves the house, the dog gets worried about its "baby" and what might happen to him/her "out there"! I find that hard to believe. &lt;P>She also thinks that when a dog follows you around the house, it thinks it is the alpha! Myself I would call that dog an insecure dog who doesn't trust its leader.&lt;P>Jan has lived a long time with dogs, but she seems mostly to be self-taught (not necessarily a bad thing). She has studied operant conditioning at the university, but her studies in ethology seem to be based on a few films about wolves that she saw on TV. Again, her approach is kind and based a lot on completely ignoring bad behavior and rewarding good behavior. That's good and I'm sure some of her advice really work. The book may be worth reading, partly for amusement... Try what she recommends, but also ask yourself if her views and observations fit you and your dog.</Comment>

            <Summary>Could be a lot better</Summary>
            <Comment>"The Dog Listener" had the potential of being a LOT better than it is. The author has some good insights that could be used in improving our relationships with our dogs, but she didn't do a great job writing about those insights. I had trouble getting past the inconsistencies in the writing, and it made me skeptical about everything she was saying. For example, on page 38 she talks about how, with one of her techniques, "the dogs calmed right down...". Then the very next page she states that she "wouldn't want to create the impression that all this came easily..." Huh? Which is it? Did she get results right away, or did they take awhile? This type of inconsistency occurs throughout.&lt;P>As another example, in chapter 6 on "Amichien Bonding", I couldn't find where she gave a good definition of what that is. She rambled on in an entire chapter without ever getting to a concise definition. Did she make the word up? Does it mean "friendly dog", or "dog-friend"? Is it part of her marketing strategy where she had to find a parallel word to Monty Roberts' "Join Up"?&lt;P>I've read all of Monty Roberts' books and I wouldn't be surprised if the author's got some marketing team behind her saying "Monty has had great success with his books. Just follow his format, change 'horses' to 'dogs', and make sure you have a tragedy in the beginning." Sorry to be so cynical but I couldn't stop thinking about this the entire time I was reading the book.</Comment>
