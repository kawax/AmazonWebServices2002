				<Summary>TOLKIEN IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!</Summary>
				<Comment>Read Eddings??? Or some other fantasies??? Like.. um, Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman...etc.. That's some nobody stuff!! Well, I started with thoes, and i got this bad taste in my mouth because they were boring and I even wished that they'd soon end. And the worst thing was; they didn't. But, to get to the point... ...Tolkien is so different!! I've read so much books in my shorty little 14 yrs life, and whatever I have read, I've never even heard about anything so magnificent, so terrific.. man, Tolkien sure can Write... WHEN READING THIS BOOK, YOU CAN ACTUALLY DIVE INTO WHOLE ANOTHER WORLD WITH SO MUCH EXITEMENT, AND MOST OF ALL, I LOVED THE ELVES AND ALL OF THE BEAUTIFUL SONGS THAT TOLKIEN HAD WRITTEN. AND I TRULY THINK, THAT ALTOUGH THE HEROS SURVIVED FROM ALL OF THE STRUGGLES, THE BOOK WAS BREATHTAKING, AND FULL OF IMAGINATION, IT WAS STILL VERY REALISTIC, ON ITS OWN LEVEL! So, you can't even compare this masterpiece into any other fantasy books..With this book, even if it's big and long, you really can't stop reading.. But, Tolkien is the best book author ever.. and I'm sure i'm not the only one who's thinking like this. TOLKIEN IS THE BEST!!!!!!!</Comment>

				<Summary>I recommend that you read these books at least seven times.</Summary>
				<Comment>The first time you read the books, you'll be caught up in the sheer adventure -- the magic, the battles, the wizards, and the sorcerers. The second time you may notice how real the landscape seems -- isn't this Earth as it once was, or should have been? The third time you'll find the history, at least 5000 years documented with fine detail. The fourth time you'll notice how much you care for the characters, and perhaps notice that even heroes can lose. The fifth time you'll examine the language -- why do these Elvish names seem so right? The sixth time it may all make sense to you -- isn't this the greatest story ever told? Finally, thinking that you have read Lord of the Rings for the last time, you turn to the Silmarillion and other stories of Middle-Earth. Then you try LotR for one last time. Then prepare yourself for that seventh reading, because now you are ready to truly understand what this genius has written -- and you will be moved in a way that no book will able to move you again.</Comment>

				<Summary>A Timeless Classic, Richly Textured, Masterfully Written</Summary>
				<Comment>These are marvelous stories, both THE HOBBIT and THE LORD OF THE RINGS (the latter known by separate titles: "The Fellowship of the Ring", "The Two Towers", and "The Return of the King". Truly, these are masterpieces of modern literature.&lt;P>In recent weeks, the release of the "The Fellowship of the Ring," to theaters across the country has spurred interest once again in this magnificent book, long a favorite of many of us aging baby-boomers. The richness of the film has resulted in immediate interest in the books by countless delighted readers, while encouraging devotees to dust off (or replace) their dog-eared, fading copies from basement boxes or attic bookshelves.&lt;P>For those who look upon this as a simple fantasy with elves, wizards, dwarves, goblins (a/k/a orcs)and of course hobbits, they miss the greatest part of the story. Tolkien has fashioned a timeless tale of humanity within a world of his own creation.&lt;P>THE HOBBIT, the first part of this great adventure, is a prequel to the main work. It is written in a more simplistic style which engages the reader (especially the younger reader) in preparation for the more complex LORD OF THE RINGS - truly an epic in the best Homeric tradition. Disparaged initially by some critics who found Tolkien's use of imaginary beings, LOTR is a major contribution to world literature, a story which will survive for many many generations. Richly detailed, the book evokes simple themes of bravery, good versus evil, love, magic, wonder and loss while treating the characters not as simple fantasy stereotypes, but as complex individuals worthy of serious consideration. The struggle of good and evil, temptation, fall and ultimate redemption is presented marvelously throughout the four volumes.&lt;P>Rooted in academic tradition (Tolkien actually created realistic, legitimate languages as well as separate mythologies), THE HOBBIT and LOTR take the reader to a very real, richly detailed world, similar, yet unique to our own.</Comment>
